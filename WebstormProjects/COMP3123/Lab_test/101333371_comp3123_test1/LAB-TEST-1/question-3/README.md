Question 3: File Module
‚óè Create a script that will do the following:
1. Remove Log files
   o remove all the files from the Logs directory, if exists
   o output the file names to delete
   o remove the Logs directory
2. Create Log files
   o create a Logs directory, if it does not exist
   o change the current process to the new Logs directory
   o create 10 log files and write some text into the file
   o output the files names to console
   o Hint: use the fs module and path module, and the process current working directory to
   build directory path. It is acceptable, to have a remove.js script and separate add.js
   script.
